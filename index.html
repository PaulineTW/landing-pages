      <h2>What is a Mandala?</h2>
      <p>The word mandala (pronunciation mon-dah-lah) means circle in Sanskrit and is representative of the belief that the universe is infinite. Creating a mandala is a spiritual ritual in Hinduism and Buddhism that reinforces the idea that everything in life is beautifully connected. We can observe mandalas through all aspects of life as seen in the sun, moon, community circles, friends, and family; all of which are representations of the word mandala. Mandalas are everywhere! They are the structures of our cells, our world, and our universe. While many mandalas exist naturally in our environment, we can create serenity, encourage reflection, and trigger relaxation by utilizing the mandala as a form of artistic expression.</p>
